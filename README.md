# Isabel Vincent Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio website – the place where I showcase my projects, share my creative journey, and have a bit of fun with design and code. This site is built with Next.js, GSAP, and Framer Motion to give it some smooth animations and responsive layouts.

## What's Inside

- **Home:** A quick intro to who I am and what I do, with a featured project display.
- **About:** My story, background in art and design, and how I approach creative challenges.
- **Artifact Pages:** Detailed case studies for projects like the Period App Redesign, Shanghai Follies Pitch, and Fizzi Sparkling Water Commercial.
- **Work:** An overview of my featured work – all designed to give you a peek into my process and skills.

## Getting Started

To run the site locally, make sure you have Node.js installed, then follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
